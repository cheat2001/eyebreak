# Build Fixes Summary

## Date: October 5, 2025

## Problem
The Xcode project file was corrupted and couldn't be opened in Xcode, preventing building and testing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Corrupted project.pbxproj File**
**Location:** `EyeBreak.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (lines 10-30)

**Issue:** Build configuration settings were incorrectly inserted in the middle of the `PBXBuildFile` section, making the project file invalid.

**Fix:** Removed the corrupted configuration text and restored proper `PBXBuildFile` entries.

### 2. **NotificationManager Protocol Conformance Error**
**Location:** `EyeBreak/Managers/NotificationManager.swift`

**Issue:** Class couldn't conform to `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` because it didn't inherit from `NSObject`.

**Fix:** Changed class declaration from `class NotificationManager` to `class NotificationManager: NSObject`.

### 3. **IdleDetector IOKit API Issues**
**Location:** `EyeBreak/Managers/IdleDetector.swift`

**Issues:**
- Incorrect usage of `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty` API
- Wrong type handling for `CFNumber`
- Extra parameter passed to function

**Fix:** 
- Simplified the API call to remove extra parameters
- Used proper `takeRetainedValue()` and force cast for CFNumber
- Fixed `CFNumberGetValue` usage

### 4. **Enum Pattern Matching Errors**
**Locations:** 
- `EyeBreak/EyeBreakApp.swift` (line 31)
- `EyeBreak/Managers/BreakTimerManager.swift` (line 66)

**Issue:** Cannot directly compare enum cases that have associated values (`.breaking(remainingSeconds:)`) using `==` operator.

**Fix:** Used proper pattern matching with `if case .breaking = state` instead of direct comparison.

### 5. **Missing Import Statement**
**Location:** `EyeBreak/Views/OnboardingView.swift`

**Issue:** Missing `import UserNotifications` caused `UNUserNotificationCenter` to be unrecognized.

**Fix:** Added `import UserNotifications` at the top of the file.

## Build Result
✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**

The app is located at:
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/EyeBreak-*/Build/Products/Debug/EyeBreak.app
```

## How to Run in Xcode

1. Open the project:
   ```bash
   open EyeBreak.xcodeproj
   ```

2. Select the "EyeBreak" scheme in Xcode

3. Click the Run button (⌘R) or Product → Run

4. The app will appear in the menu bar with an eye icon

## Known Warnings (Non-critical)

- **Asset Catalog Warnings:** Some app icon sizes don't match expected dimensions
  - `AppIcon-128.png` is 256x256 but should be 128x128
  - `AppIcon-16.png` is 32x32 but should be 16x16
  
  These are minor and don't prevent the app from running, but should be fixed for production.

## Next Steps

1. Test the app functionality:
   - Start/stop timer
   - Take manual break
   - Configure settings
   - Test notifications
   - Test screen blur feature

2. Fix icon sizes if needed using the `generate_placeholder_icons.sh` script

3. Consider signing the app with a development certificate for proper entitlements testing

## Technical Details

- **macOS Deployment Target:** 14.0
- **Swift Version:** 5.0
- **Xcode Version:** 15.0+
- **Architecture:** arm64 (Apple Silicon)
