## 🌟 The 20-20-20 Rule

Digital eye strain affects millions of people who spend hours in front of screens. The **20-20-20 rule** is a simple, scientifically-backed method to reduce eye fatigue:

> **Every 20 minutes** of screen time  
> Look at something **20 feet** away (about 6 meters)  
> For **20 seconds**

This gives your eye muscles a chance to relax and reduces the risk of eye strain, headaches, dry eyes, and neck pain.

- **Swift**: 5.9+

## 🚀 Installation

### Download the App (Recommended) ⭐️

1. **[Download EyeBreak-v2.1.0.dmg](https://github.com/cheat2001/eyebreak/releases/latest)** 
2. **Remove quarantine** (required for unsigned apps):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   xattr -cr EyeBreak-v2.1.0.dmg

3. **Open** the DMG file
4. **Drag** `EyeBreak.app` to your `Applications` folder
5. **Launch**:
