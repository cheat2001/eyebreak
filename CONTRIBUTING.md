## Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use `// MARK: -` to organize code sections
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Use explicit `self` only when required by the compiler

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Keep views small and focused
- Extract reusable components
- Use `@State` for view-local state
- Use `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` for shared state
- Use `@AppStorage` for persisted settings

### Naming Conventions

- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `BreakTimerManager`)
- **Variables/Properties**: `camelCase` (e.g., `workInterval`)
- **Constants**: `camelCase` (e.g., `defaultWorkInterval`)
- **Functions**: `camelCase` with clear verb (e.g., `startTimer()`)
- **Enums**: `PascalCase` for type, `camelCase` for cases

### Code Organization

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
private var timer: Timer?
@Published var state: TimerState

// MARK: - Initialization
init() { }

// MARK: - Public Methods
func startTimer() { }
func stopTimer() { }

// MARK: - Private Methods
private func updateTimer() { }

// MARK: - Helpers
private func formatTime(_ seconds: Int) -> String { }
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure you've tested:

- [ ] App builds without errors or warnings
- [ ] App runs on a clean install (delete app data first)
- [ ] All core features work:
  - [ ] Timer starts and counts down correctly
  - [ ] Break overlay appears and dismisses
  - [ ] Notifications appear (with permission)
  - [ ] Idle detection pauses timer
  - [ ] Settings persist across launches
  - [ ] Statistics update correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - [ ] Mac sleeps during timer
  - [ ] Screen Recording permission denied
  - [ ] Notifications permission denied
  - [ ] Multiple displays
  - [ ] Rapid start/stop operations

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` if you change functionality
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update relevant documentation in `/docs` folder if needed

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Add dark mode support to break overlay

- Implement color scheme detection
- Update overlay colors for dark mode
- Add system appearance change listener
- Test on both light and dark modes
```

Good commit message format:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
